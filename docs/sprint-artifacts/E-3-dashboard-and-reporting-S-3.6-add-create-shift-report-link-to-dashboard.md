# Story: Add "Create Shift Report" Link to Dashboard

## As a shift leader,

I want a clear link or button on the dashboard to create a new shift report

## So that

I can easily access the reporting form.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A "Create New Shift Report" button or link is present on the main dashboard page (`/`).
- This link navigates the user to the `/shift-report/create` page.
- The link should only be visible to users with the `shift_leader` role.

## Definition of Done

- All acceptance criteria met.
- Link implemented on dashboard page.
- Role-based visibility ensured.
- Story status updated to 'review'.

## Project Context

This story enhances the usability of the shift reporting feature by providing direct navigation from the dashboard.
It depends on Story S-3.1 being completed.
