# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-10-29
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** BIP

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Improving the Shift Reporting App Proposal with LEAN principles

**Session Goals:** To generate ideas that enhance the app's alignment with LEAN philosophy, focusing on visual management, continuous improvement, and waste reduction, in order to strengthen the project proposal.

**Techniques Used:** Five Whys, Mini Value Stream Mapping, LEAN Kansei Engineering

**Total Ideas Generated:** 6

### Key Themes Identified:

- **LEAN Waste Reduction:** A recurring theme was identifying and eliminating specific forms of LEAN waste (double entry, waiting, searching, errors) in the current information flow.
- **Data-Driven Confidence:** The ultimate driver for this project is not just about tracking numbers, but about providing accurate data to maintain leadership's confidence in the operation's ability to perform.

## Technique Sessions

### Technique 1: Five Whys - Uncovering the Root Problem

**Goal:** To understand the deep business impact of the current reporting process.

**Analysis:**

1.  **The Problem:** Manual reporting leads to typos and errors.
    *   **Why is that a problem?** Because with multiple shift leaders editing the same Excel file, the chance of typos is high.
2.  **The Impact of Errors:** These typos can be "catastrophic."
    *   **Why are they catastrophic?** Because they corrupt the database, meaning reports sent to the CEO and leadership are based on wrong information.
3.  **The Consequence of Bad Data:** Leaders make wrong decisions.
    *   **Why is that a problem?** Because it also wastes the team's time explaining the errors instead of doing productive work.
4.  **The Core Fear:** Wrong numbers make the warehouse operation look "not in control."
    *   **Why does that matter?** Because in a market that demands fast delivery, it signals to leadership that the operation cannot be trusted to meet customer promises.
5.  **The Ultimate Business Impact:** The CEO looks bad and makes poor decisions that cause the company to lose money.

**Insight:** The core problem this app solves is not just "bad data." It's a **strategic risk management tool** that protects leadership confidence and prevents poor, money-losing decisions.

### Technique 2: Mini Value Stream Mapping - Identifying Waste

**Goal:** To map the current manual process and identify steps that constitute "waste" in LEAN terms.

**Process Map: Machine Breakdown Event**

1.  **Trigger:** A machine breaks down on the warehouse floor.
2.  **Step 1: Interruption.** The Shift Leader stops their work to make a phone call to the Tech Team. (Waste: Interruption, Task Switching).
3.  **Step 2: First Entry.** The Shift Leader writes initial details in a local logbook.
4.  **Step 3: Second Entry.** The Shift Leader enters the *same information* into the main Excel report. (Waste: **Double Entry / Over-processing**).
5.  **Step 4: Information Silo.** The Tech Team performs the repair and writes the final details (cause, repair time) in their own separate report at the end of their shift.
6.  **Step 5: The Hunt.** To finalize their own report, the Shift Leader must find the Tech Team's report, locate the correct entry, and copy the information back into their Excel sheet. (Waste: **Searching, Waiting, Defects** from transcription errors).

**Insight:** The current process is fragmented across 3 documents and relies on manual, interrupt-driven communication. A single-source-of-truth application would eliminate nearly all of these wasteful steps, saving time and dramatically improving data accuracy.

### Technique 3: LEAN Kansei Engineering - Designing for Control

**Goal:** To connect the desired feeling of being "In Control" to specific, tangible dashboard features.

**Target Feeling:** In Control

**Feature Ideas to Create This Feeling:**

1.  **At-a-Glance Status:** A clear, top-level indicator (e.g., a large green checkmark or red X) that provides an instant summary of whether the operation is on track.
2.  **Prioritized Focus List:** A section titled "Top 3 Risks & Opportunities Today" that tells a manager exactly where to focus their attention, rather than forcing them to hunt for insights.
3.  **Instant Drill-Down:** The ability for a manager to click any number or KPI on the dashboard and instantly see the underlying data or specific shift reports that contribute to it.

**Insight:** The feeling of "In Control" is not achieved by displaying vast amounts of data, but by providing information that is **Prioritized, Actionable, and Traceable.**

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities

_Ideas ready to implement now_

- **Reframe the Core Purpose:** The most critical change is to frame the app's purpose not just as a convenience, but as a strategic tool. The proposal should explicitly state that the app mitigates financial risk by ensuring leadership has accurate data, thereby protecting their confidence and decision-making quality.
- **Enhance the Dashboard Vision:** The proposal's dashboard feature should be described with the goal of making a manager feel "In Control." Mention specific design ideas like an at-a-glance status indicator, a prioritized list of daily risks, and instant drill-down capabilities.
- **Quantify the Waste Elimination:** Use the findings from the Value Stream Map to list the specific types of "LEAN waste" the app eliminates (e.g., double entry, waiting, searching). This provides a concrete, evidence-based justification for the project.
- **Define Success with LEAN Standards:**
    - **5S Thinking (Structured Reporting):** Emphasize that the app will support structured and standardized reporting, reflecting the 5S principles of Sort, Set in order, Shine, Standardize, and Sustain. This reduces variability and makes reports easier to understand.
    - **Lean Metrics:** Define clear, quantifiable Lean improvement targets in the proposal, such as: reducing average report completion time by 60% and increasing data accuracy to 95%.

### Future Innovations

_Ideas requiring development/research_

- **Integrated Tech Team Module:** A future version of the app could include a dedicated module for the tech team. This would not only allow them to update the status of repairs in real-time (eliminating their separate report), but could also serve their internal needs, such as managing their job queue and creating an automated 'shift handover' summary. This would provide value to them directly, increasing adoption.

### Moonshots

_Ambitious, transformative concepts_

- *No moonshots identified in this session, but this is a great area for future creative thinking.*

### Insights and Learnings

_Key realizations from the session_

- The most powerful way to frame this app in the proposal is not as a reporting tool, but as a **strategic risk management asset.** It actively prevents financial loss by ensuring decisions are based on accurate data and protects the operational integrity in the eyes of leadership.

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Integrate LEAN Philosophy Throughout the Proposal

- Rationale: This provides a strong, consistent, and respected framework for the project, elevating it from a simple tech upgrade to a strategic business improvement initiative.
- Next steps: 1. Rewrite the proposal's "Purpose" section to use the "Five Whys" insight. 2. Enhance the "Dashboard" feature description with the "In Control" ideas. 3. Add a new subsection that explicitly lists the types of LEAN "waste" the app eliminates.
- Resources needed: The notes from this brainstorming session and time to edit the proposal.md file.
- Timeline: Before the next project group meeting.

## Reflection and Follow-up

### What Worked Well

Combining structured techniques like "Five Whys" and "Value Stream Mapping" with a creative one like "Kansei Engineering" gave us both a strong logical foundation and innovative ideas for the proposal.

### Areas for Further Exploration

A deeper dive into the Tech Team's specific internal workflow could uncover more detailed requirements for the 'Integrated Tech Team Module' future innovation.

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

Presenting the LEAN-focused arguments from this session to your project group and then collaboratively editing the proposal.md file.

### Questions That Emerged

*No new questions emerged during this session.*

### Next Session Planning

- **Suggested topics:** A deep-dive into the Tech Team's workflow.
- **Recommended timeframe:** After the proposal has been updated.
- **Preparation needed:** Review the updated proposal.
- **Adopt a PDCA / Kaizen Cycle:** For the MVP itself, ensure a continuous improvement loop (Plan → Do → Check → Act) is part of the process. Each iteration should be validated with real user feedback before scaling further.
