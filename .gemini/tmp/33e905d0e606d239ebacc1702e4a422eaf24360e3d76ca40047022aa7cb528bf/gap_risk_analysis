### Critical Gaps

-   **Error Handling and Edge Cases:** While a centralized error handling strategy is defined in `architecture.md`, specific stories that explicitly cover all error handling scenarios and edge cases (beyond basic form validation) across the application are not granularly detailed within `epics.md`. This is a minor gap that can be addressed during sprint planning.
    -   *Impact:* Potential for inconsistent error messaging or unhandled edge cases in implementation.
-   No other critical gaps were identified regarding missing core requirements, architectural concerns, or setup stories.

### Sequencing Issues

-   The story sequencing in `epics.md` appears logical, with foundational elements preceding feature development. No major sequencing issues or circular dependencies were detected.

### Potential Contradictions

-   No contradictions were found between the `PRD.md`, `architecture.md`, `epics.md`, `ux-design-specification.md`, and `tests/test-plan.md`. All documents align consistently on project scope, technical approach, and user experience.

### Gold-Plating and Scope Creep

-   No instances of gold-plating or scope creep were detected within the MVP scope defined by Epics 1, 2, and 3. Post-MVP features (Epics 4 and 5) are clearly demarcated as growth/vision, aligning with the `PRD.md`.

### Testability Review (Test Plan)

-   The `tests/test-plan.md` document provides a comprehensive system-level testability assessment.
    -   **Controllability:** The plan outlines using test data factories and API seeding to control system state.
    -   **Observability:** The plan covers maintainability NFRs, including CI checks for code quality and test coverage, and Playwright tests for observability validation (error tracking, telemetry headers).
    -   **Reliability:** The plan includes specific NFR tests for reliability, covering error handling, retries, and network disconnection.
-   The `test-plan.md` also features a robust "Risks and Mitigations" section, identifying key quality-related risks (e.g., R-SEC-001 for unauthorized access, R-PERF-001 for dashboard slowness) and proposing mitigation strategies. This proactively flags testability concerns and addresses them within the testing strategy.
