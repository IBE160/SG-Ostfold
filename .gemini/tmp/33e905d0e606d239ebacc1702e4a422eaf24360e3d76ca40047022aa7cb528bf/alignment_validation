### PRD ↔ Architecture Alignment

- **Verification:** The `architecture.md` document, which has been recently updated with specific technology versions and expanded implementation patterns (Communication and Lifecycle), demonstrates strong alignment with the `PRD.md`.
- **Architectural Support for PRD Requirements:**
    - **Functional:** All core functional requirements (User & Access Management, Shift Report Management, Historical Data & Reporting, Performance Monitoring & Dashboards) are explicitly supported by the architectural decisions detailed in `architecture.md` (e.g., Supabase for data and authentication, Next.js Route Handlers for APIs, Next.js for frontend).
    - **Non-Functional:** Performance, Security, Scalability, and Accessibility NFRs from the PRD are directly addressed in the Architecture. This includes Vercel's CDN and Next.js rendering strategies for performance, Supabase RLS and JWTs for security, scalable Supabase/Vercel for scalability, and adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA principles (derived from UX and architecture).
- **Contradictions/Additions:** No significant contradictions or architectural "gold-plating" beyond the PRD's defined scope were identified. Post-MVP features in the Architecture (e.g., AI integration, background jobs) are consistent with the PRD's Growth and Vision sections.
- **Implementation Patterns & Versions:** The updated `architecture.md` directly addresses previous validation findings by including refined implementation patterns (naming, data formatting, communication, lifecycle) and verified technology versions.

### PRD ↔ Stories Coverage

- **Mapping:** The `epics.md` document provides a comprehensive breakdown of PRD requirements into distinct epics and granular user stories. All core functional requirements within the PRD's MVP scope are fully covered by stories within Epics 1, 2, and 3.
- **Uncovered Requirements/Stories:** No PRD requirements were found to be lacking story coverage within the MVP scope. Conversely, all stories explicitly trace back to and support specific PRD requirements.
- **Acceptance Criteria Alignment:** The detailed acceptance criteria provided for each story in `epics.md` are well-aligned with the PRD's success criteria, ensuring clarity on what constitutes a successful implementation of each requirement.

### Architecture ↔ Stories Implementation Check

- **Reflection of Architectural Decisions:** The stories in `epics.md` consistently reflect the architectural decisions articulated in `architecture.md`. For instance, Story 1.1 (Project Foundation & CI/CD) mandates the use of Next.js and Supabase as core technologies, and Story 1.2 (User Authentication & Role-Based Access) specifies implementation via Supabase Auth and RLS.
- **Technical Tasks Alignment:** The technical notes and acceptance criteria within individual stories are congruent with the overarching architectural approach, including API patterns (Next.js Route Handlers) and data handling strategies.
- **Architectural Constraints:** No stories were found to introduce technical approaches or solutions that would violate the architectural constraints or principles established in `architecture.md`.
- **Infrastructure/Setup Stories:** Story 1.1 explicitly addresses the foundational project setup and CI/CD, which are crucial for establishing the architectural components defined.
