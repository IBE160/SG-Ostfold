### UX Coverage

-   **UX Requirements in PRD:** The `PRD.md` explicitly defines User Experience Principles and Key Interactions, which are further detailed in the `ux-design-specification.md`. This ensures UX is a foundational aspect of the project.
-   **UX Implementation Tasks in Stories:** User stories in `epics.md` include tasks and acceptance criteria that incorporate UX considerations. For example, Story 1.3's AC refers to UX spec error states for form validation, and Story 3.1 references the dashboard layout from `ux-design-specification.md`.
-   **Architecture Supports UX Requirements:** The `architecture.md` confirms support for UX principles, particularly regarding performance (e.g., Vercel CDN, Next.js rendering strategies for fast page loads) and responsiveness (Next.js with Tailwind CSS for adapting to various screen sizes).
-   **Identified UX Concerns:** No significant UX concerns were identified that are not addressed or planned for in the existing documentation.

### Accessibility and Usability Validation

-   **Accessibility Requirement Coverage:** The `PRD.md` sets an Accessibility Level target (WCAG 2.1 AA), which is supported by `ux-design-specification.md` and acknowledged in the `architecture.md`. The `tests/test-plan.md` includes accessibility testing as part of its NFRs.
-   **Responsive Design Validation:** `ux-design-specification.md` details responsive grid layouts, and `architecture.md` confirms Tailwind CSS for robust responsive design implementation.
-   **User Flow Completeness:** The critical user flows identified in `ux-design-specification.md` (Shift Registration, Manager KPI Analysis) are thoroughly covered by the stories in `epics.md`.
